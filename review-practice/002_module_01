# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: CLUSTER ADMINISTRATION **
# GOAL: Allocate the shards in a way that satisfies a given set of
#       requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP: /

# Download the exam version of Elasticsearch
# Deploy the cluster `eoc-06-cluster`, with three nodes named 
#    `node1`, `node2`, and `node3`
# Configure the Zen Discovery module of each node so that they can 
#    communicate
# Start the cluster


# Create the index `hamlet-1` with two primary shards and one 
#    replica
# Add some documents to `hamlet-1` by running the command below 

PUT hamlet-1/_doc/_bulk

{"line_number":"1","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Whos there?"}
